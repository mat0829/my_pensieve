user has many memories
memories have many emotions and players
but emotions can certainly have many memories too
likewise with players

("belong to many" in English, like we might say an emotion "belongs to many memories", but AR would call that has many)
right so you have two many-to-many relationships
so you might need a MemoryEmotion and a MemoryPlayer class
